Put each of the following into separate svn projects:

/etc/rails

/etc/monit.d

/etc/mongrel_cluster

/usr/local/apache2/conf


Deploy each separately from the others by doing an "svn update" via a Cron job.

Each of the above would then be deployed from a known "tag" or sorts known as "production" or the like.
The "production" tag would contain a series of versions, one after another rather than a specific tag such
as "4.1.2" or the like.  This allows for automatic deployments of code with a watcher process that knows
when a new version has been rolled that then leads to a service reset or some other post-deployment action
to make the newly deployed config change "live" so to speak.
