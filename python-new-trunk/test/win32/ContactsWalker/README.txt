Directions for use:

Step (1):  Unpack the ZIP file - you had to do this before you could read this README file.

Step (2):  Edit the file named "run-DEMO.cmd" and place your SalesForce Credentials in the proper places for --username= and --password=.

There is no place to put a token for added security.

Step (3):  Run the file named "run-DEMO.cmd".

Each time the file named "run-DEMO.cmd" is run 4 more random Leads will be added and the remaining Leads will get an additional score.

Step (4):  Repeat Step (3) as often as necessary.

Enjoy !


CHANGELOG:

09-15-2008 3:55p  Now the Demo should handle Leads that were converted to Contacts., Company names no longer have '"' chars.
