sfdcexport

$ID: $

The sfdcexport project provides a utility to automatically request and
download a weekly export as provided by Salesforce.com Professional
and Enterprise editions. sfdcexport operates by accessing the
Salesforce.com website and 'scraping' the html to simulate a user with
a web browser.


Requirements: 

Python 2.3.4. Has not been tested with earlier or later
versions of Python.  Earlier versions may work, but may also require
additional libraries that have been included in 2.3.4. 2.4 is expected to work "out of the box."

This utility requires that the ClientCookie 1.0.3 library be
installed. This can be downloaded from:
http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie/ 

Note that Python 2.4 contains cookielib, which provides most of
ClientCookie. sfdcexport is not currently configured to make use of
this, though this is on the TODO list.


Installation:

Copy the example config file in the config directory to 'example.conf'.
Go through the file and set the config parameters as necessary.

Any passwords must be base64 encoded to provide a slight increase in the
security of storing passwords in a config file. Don't fool yourself - this
isn't secure, it just hides the key under a mat.

Use the passencode script in the bin directory to prompt for a password and
provide the base64 encoded version to include in the config file.


Usage:

Once completely configured, just run sfdcexport in the bin directory
and wait. An export may take several hours to become ready for
download and then to do the actual download. The script will make the
initial request and then periodically check the status of the export
until it is finally ready to be downloaded. If the script is
interupted for any reason, restarting it should allow it to pick up
where it left off.
