TODO list for sfdcexport


Direct-to-disk spooling of segment downloads:

Exporter currently spools downloads to memory completely, then to
disk. Spooling directly to disk would make export much lighter on
memory consumption making it more feasible to run multiple download
threads.

--
Threading

Would speed up downloads, but requires Direct-to-disk first.

--
Python 2.4 compatibility

Make use of Python 2.4's cookielib in lieu of having to install ClientCookie
General compatibility test

--
Windows compatibility

sfdcexport was not built with Windows in mind. Perhaps a Python expert on 
Windows might adapt the code (withtout breaking UNIX compatibility) and 
write the necessary batch files to set up environment and launch 
the exporter.

--
MacOS X compatibility

Should just work, but I've got no machine to test it on.
