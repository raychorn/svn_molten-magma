Requirements:

Python 2.3.5 (python 2.4 should work, but is untested)
	fpconst 0.6.0 or later
	pyXML 0.8.3 or later
	SOAPpy 0.12.0_rc1 (patched as instructed in Installation section)
	
	

Installation:

(Assumes that user's shell is bash. Modify commands for setting environment vars accordingly if using another shell)

1) Install *patched* SOAPpy 0.12.0_rc1 or later:

   Get it from:
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26590&package_id=18246
   or if that doesn't work, go to http://pywebsvcs.sf.net and find it from there
   
   This toolkit was built against 0.12.0_rc1. Later versions may work flawlessly but
   this cannot be known at this time.
   
   Following the install instructions in the SOAPpy README, you will be downloading 
   and installing two support packages first:

    - fpconst 0.6.0 or later,
      <http://research.warnes.net/projects/rzope/fpconst/>

    - pyXML 0.8.3 or later, <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net>

   After installing these, but BEFORE installing SOAPpy itself, patch the SOAPpy source tree
   with both patches in the install directory:
   
   1) cd into the SOAPpy distribution directory (i.e., SOAPpy-0.12.0)
   2) apply the first patch:  $ patch -p1 < /your/path/to/pysfdc/patches/SOAPpy/SOAPpy_force_refs_off.patch
   3) apply the second patch: $ patch -p1 < /your/path/to/pysfdc/patches/SOAPpy/SOAPpy_force_typed_map_elements.patch
   
   Now, continue the SOAPpy install as per the SOAPpy README
   
   
 2) Place sForce partner WSDL file in the WSDL directory for the version of the sForce API you wish to use.
    NB: This toolkit was developed against API 6.0. 7.0 should work, although the upsert command has not
    yet been developed as of 12/16/2005
    
 
 3) Create a pysfdc.conf file. Copy the starter file and edit the entries necessary
 (i.e., those dealing with pathnames, and optionally usernames and passwords for the tests).
 
 
 4) set PYSFDC_HOME environment variable to be the path to the pysfdc package directory:
 
 $ export PYSFDC_HOME=/your/path/to/pysfdc
 
 
 5) Include PYSFDC_HOME/src in your PYTHONPATH:
 
 $ export PYTHONPATH=PYTHONHPATH:$PYSFDC_HOME/src
 
 
 6) in src/tests run runAllTests.py

 $ python runAllTests.py
